 After either ten batsmen have been dismissed or a fixed number of overs have been completed the innings ends and the two teams then swap roles .
 The winning team is the one that scores the most runs including any extras gained during their innings .
 At the start of each game two batsmen and eleven fielders enter the field of play .
 The play begins when a member of the fielding team known as the bowler delivers the ball from one end of the pitch to the other towards the wicket at that end in front of which stands one of the batsmen known as the striker .
 The striker takes guard on a crease drawn on the pitch four feet in front of the wicket .
 His role is to prevent the ball from hitting the stumps by use of his bat and simultaneously to strike it well enough to score runs .
