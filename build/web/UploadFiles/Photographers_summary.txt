 Their images are proof that photography mattersnow more than ever .
 By Robert Draper .
 Thirtyfour years before the birth of this magazine the Danish philosopher Sren Kierkegaard sourly prophesied a banal fate for the newly popularized art of photography .
 With the daguerreotype he observed everyone will be able to have their portrait takenformerly it was only the prominentand at the same time everything is being done to make us all look exactly the same so we shall only need one portrait .
 The National Geographic Society did not set out to test Kierkegaards thesis at least not right away .
 Its mission was exploration and the gray pages of its official journal did not exactly constitute a visual orgy .
 Years would go by before National Geographics explorers would begin using the camera as a tool to bring back what is now its chief source of fame photographic stories that can alter perceptions and at their best change lives .
 By wresting a precious particle of the world from time and space and holding it absolutely still a great photograph can explode the totality of our world such that we never see it quite the same again .
 After all as Kierkegaard also wrote the truth is a snare you cannot have it without being caught .
 Today photography has become a global cacophony of freezeframes .
 Millions of pictures are uploaded every minute .
 Correspondingly everyone is a subject and knows itany day now we will be adding the unguarded moment to the endangered species list .
 Its on this hyperegalitarian quasiOrwellian alltoocameraready terra infirma that National Geographics photographers continue to stand out .
