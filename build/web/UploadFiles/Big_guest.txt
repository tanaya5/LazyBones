Big dataÂ is a term forÂ data setsÂ that are so large or complex that traditionalÂ data processingÂ application softwareÂ is inadequate to deal with them. Challenges includeÂ capture,Â storage,Â analysis,Â data curation, search,Â sharing,Â transfer,Â visualization,Â querying, updating andÂ information privacy. The term  "big data" often refers simply to the use ofÂ predictive analytics,Â user behavior analytics, or certain other advanced data analytics methods that extract value from data, and seldom to a particular size of data set. "There is little doubt that the quantities of data now available are indeed large, but thatâ??s not the most relevant characteristic of this new data ecosystem.Â Analysis of data sets can find new correlations to "spot business trends, prevent diseases, combat crime and so on. Scientists, business executives, practitioners of medicine, advertising andÂ governmentsÂ alike regularly meet difficulties with large data-sets in areas includingÂ Internet search, finance,Â urban informatics, andÂ business informatics. Scientists encounter limitations inÂ e-ScienceÂ work, includingÂ meteorology,Â genomics,Â connectomics, complex physics simulations, biology and environmental research.
