Photographers use their cameras as tools of exploration, passports to inner sanctums, instruments for change. Their images are proof that photography mattersâ??now more than ever.
By Robert Draper
Thirty-four years before the birth of this magazine, the Danish philosopher SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard sourly prophesied a banal fate for the newly popularized art of photography. â??With the daguerreotype,â?? he observed, â??everyone will be able to have their portrait takenâ??formerly it was only the prominentâ??and at the same time everything is being done to make us all look exactly the same, so we shall only need one portrait.â??

The National Geographic Society did not set out to test Kierkegaardâ??s thesis, at least not right away. Its mission was exploration, and the gray pages of its official journal did not exactly constitute a visual orgy. Years would go by before National Geographicâ??s explorers would begin using the camera as a tool to bring back what is now its chief source of fame: photographic stories that can alter perceptions and, at their best, change lives.

By wresting a precious particle of the world from time and space and holding it absolutely still, a great photograph can explode the totality of our world, such that we never see it quite the same again. After all, as Kierkegaard also wrote, â??the truth is a snare: you cannot have it, without being caught.â??

Today photography has become a global cacophony of freeze-frames. Millions of pictures are uploaded every minute. Correspondingly, everyone is a subject, and knows itâ??any day now we will be adding the unguarded moment to the endangered species list. Itâ??s on this hyper-egalitarian, quasi-Orwellian, all-too-camera-ready â??terra infirmaâ?? that National Geographicâ??s photographers continue to stand out. Why they do so is only partly explained by the innately personal choices (which lens for which lighting for which moment) that help define a photographerâ??s style. Instead, the very best of their images remind us that a photograph has the power to do infinitely more than document. It can transport us to unseen worlds.

When I tell people that I work for this magazine, I see their eyes grow wide, and I know what will happen when I add, as I must: â??Sorry, Iâ??m just one of the writers.â?? A National Geographic photographer is the personification of worldliness, the witness to all earthly beauty, the occupant of everybodyâ??s dream job. Iâ??ve seen The Bridges of Madison Countyâ??I get it, Iâ??m not bitter. But I have also frequently been thrown into the company of a National Geographic photographer at work, and what I have seen is everything to admire and nothing whatsoever to envy. If what propels them is ferocious determination to tell a story through transcendent images, what encumbers their quest is a daily litany of obstruction (excess baggage fees, inhospitable weather, a Greek chorus of â??noâ??), interrupted now and then by disaster (broken bones, malaria, imprisonment). Away from home for many months at a timeâ??missing birthdays, holidays, school playsâ??they can find themselves serving as unwelcome ambassadors in countries hostile to the West. Or sitting in a tree for a week. Or eating bugs for dinner. I might add that Einstein, who snarkily referred to photographers as lichtaffen, meaning â??monkeys drawn to light,â?? did not live by 3 a.m. wake-up calls. Letâ??s not confuse nobility with glamour. What transfixes me, almost as much as their images, is my colleaguesâ?? cheerful capacity for misery.

Apparently they wouldnâ??t have it any other way. The lodestone of the camera tugged at each of them from their disparate origins (a small town in Indiana or Azerbaijan, a polio isolation ward, the South African military), and over time their work would reflect differentiated passions: human conflict and vanishing cultures, big cats and tiny insects, the desert and the sea. What do the National Geographic photographers share? A hunger for the unknown, the courage to be ignorant, and the wisdom to recognize that, as one says, â??the photograph is never takenâ??it is always given.â??
